## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of this app was to allow users to manage and track inventory items while ensuring required permissions were properly handled before use. The app addresses the user need for a simple, 
organized way to manage inventory data while maintaining transparency and control over permissions such as storage and SMS access.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app?

The app includes a login screen, a permission screen, an inventory list screen, and an item detail screen that supports creating, updating, and deleting items. 
Each screen serves a focused purpose and guides users through the app in a logical, easy-to-follow flow.

## How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The UI design prioritizes clarity and simplicity by using straightforward layouts, clear labels, and logical navigation between screens. 
This approach was successful because it minimized user effort and made the app easy to understand without requiring prior experience.

## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use?

I approached development incrementally, implementing one feature at a time and verifying functionality before moving forward. 
I used structured activities, utility classes, and Android lifecycle-aware components to keep the code organized and maintainable.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

The app was tested through manual testing on an emulator by navigating through screens, granting and denying permissions, and verifying expected behavior. 
This process is important because it helped identify logic issues and ensured the app handled user actions and edge cases correctly.

## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge was managing Android permissions in a user-friendly way while maintaining proper app flow. I addressed this by separating permission logic into its 
own activity and using modern permission request APIs to improve reliability and clarity.

## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I was particularly successful in the permission handling component, where I demonstrated an understanding of Android’s permission system, activity navigation, and user communication. 
This component shows my ability to balance technical requirements with user-centered design.
